## Project Overview
The **Customer Churn Prediction** project aims to identify customers who are likely to leave a service (churn) based on historical data. Predicting churn helps companies take proactive actions to retain customers, reducing revenue loss.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** from Kaggle. It includes customer demographics, account information, and churn status.

**Key Features:**
- Customer demographics: `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`
- Account information: `tenure`, `Contract`, `PaymentMethod`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`
- Churn label: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
- Explore data types, missing values, and basic statistics.
- Visualize distributions and correlations.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Convert categorical variables into numeric formats using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Normalize or scale numerical features if required.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Create new features if needed (e.g., tenure groups, average charges).
- Select features most correlated with churn.

### 4. Model Selection and Training
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
- Evaluate using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Compare model performances.
- Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
- Visualize feature importance to understand key churn drivers.

### 6. Deployment (Optional)
- Export the trained model using `pickle` or `joblib`.
- Create a simple interface for predicting churn for new customers.
