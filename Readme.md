## Project Overview
The **Customer Churn Prediction** project focuses on identifying customers who are likely to leave a service (churn) based on historical data. Accurate churn prediction enables companies to take proactive retention measures, minimizing revenue loss.

---

## Dataset
We use the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** from Kaggle. It contains customer demographics, account information, and churn status.

**Key Features:**
- **Customer demographics:** `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`
- **Account information:** `tenure`, `Contract`, `PaymentMethod`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`
- **Churn label:** `Churn` (Yes/No)

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Explore data types, missing values, and descriptive statistics.
- Visualize distributions and correlations among features.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Convert categorical variables into numeric formats (one-hot encoding / label encoding).
- Normalize or scale numerical features as needed.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Create new features if necessary (e.g., tenure groups, average charges).
- Select features most correlated with churn.

### 4. Model Selection and Training
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
- Evaluate models using metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Compare performances of different models.
- Apply cross-validation for robustness.
- Visualize feature importance to understand key drivers of churn.

### 6. Deployment (Optional)
- Export the trained model using `pickle` or `joblib`.
- Create a simple interface for predicting churn of new customers (Flask or Streamlit).
